## Collage Maker For Linux
Ever had a huge number of images with no way to organize them?

This handy script will recursively search for images in a directory you pass at the command line, and merge and resize them horizontally into one large timeline sorted by file modification time. You can pass an image extension as an optional second command-line argument. (The default is .jpg)

Ex. ``bash collage.sh MontrealTest .jpg`` will combine all .jpg files in MontrealTest to produce MontrealTest.jpg
