This is a [bitmap image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) software suite that allows you to scale and merge bitmap images to your heart's content! Clone the repo and run `$ make`. This should make the three executables `bmp_info`, `bmp_scale` and `bmp_collage`. The first will give you some basic information about your BMP file, which you pass as an argument. `bmp_scale` takes an input and output filename and will scale your input and save to output. `bmp_collage` allows you to scale and put one image on top of another. There are some test images and running `$ make test` will give some examples of all three executables in action.

This project required accessing and writing individual bytes of these binary BMP files using C. This project was also inspired by an assignment from McGill University's Software Systems course.
